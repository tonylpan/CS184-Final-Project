<h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
<p>
  This project will be a 2D fluid dynamics simulation, using the Navier-Stokes equations to approximate the behavior of
  homogenous incompressible fluids. Physics calculations will be performed on the GPU, through GLSL fragment shaders.
  Our end goal is to create an interactive real-time 2D simulation of fluids.
</p>

<br>

<h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we are trying to solve the problem of rendering realistic fluids in a 2D space. The challenge will be graphically capturing the
    natural diffusion of a fluid based on its viscosity, as well as its interaction with other fluids. We will solve this by using the GLSL fragment
    shaders introduced in Project 3-2.
</p>

<br>

<h2 align="middle">Goals/Deliverables</h2>
<p>
  What we will deliver is an interactive demo showcasing fluid physics. It will consist of a rectangular canvas that starts off
  completely empty. Upon clicking the mouse cursor in the canvas, fluid will be inserted at that point on the canvas. The fluid
  will move around according to the Navier-Stokes equations. You will be able to click around and watch the fluid mix, until you
  get tired of watching the same thing too long, in which case you can reset the demo so it is empty once again.
</p>
<o>
  If for any reason we are ahead of schedule, there are other elements that we would like to add on to the demo. First off,
  adding different colors (toggleable using the keyboard) would help the demo be more artistically pleasing. If we have a lot of
  extra time, then we could also add in a key that would insert solid objects that the fluid would have to move around. Other
  possibilities could be explored as well, such as experimenting with fluids of varying density.
</p>

<br>

<h2 align="middle">Schedule</h2>
<p>
Week 1 - Begin project! Be able to display the canvas and record mouse and keyboard inputs. <br>
Week 2 - Add fluids using mouse. Should be able to see fluids, but they shouldn't move yet. <br>
Week 3 - Allow fluids to move using the Navier-Stokes equations. Finish and submit milestone deliverables. <br>
Week 4 - Debug and polish up the demo. <br>

This project will be developed on standard computing platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS) and the demo will be run on Google Chrome.
